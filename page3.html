							<h2>Hello World</h2>
							<p>This is the first blog post that I am making!!</p>
							<p>Right now we are finishing up with week 1 fundamentals!!  We took our exam today and all of team oxygen had a passing grade.  At first I was a little nervous but still confident in what I learned this week.  This week has been a great experience learning about the actual computer machine and what each part does.  Day one was actually math!  Decimal numbers to binary to hexadecimals.  It's felt like forever since I've had to use my math portion of my brain.</p>
							<p>Day 2, 3 and 4 was all about HTML and CSS coding.  This is what I've been enjoying the most.  Actually this website is the result of what we've been learning.  This is still just the initial look until we get javascript going so it's not the greatest right now.  But please keep stopping by to see how this page continues to transform. </p>
							<p>That is all for now....signing off.</p>
